CS 210 Module Eight Journal 
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
This was our third project for C++ (CS210). The code's purpose was to create a grocery tracker that would be able to have a histogram, list the groceries, search the items, or exit the program. This was for a hypothetical company for ChadaTech to help with GrocerTracker. 
What did you do particularly well? 
I did particularly well in the menu features. It was a simple output and option design. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make you code mroe efficient, secure, and so on? 
I struggled with the debugging process for a bit. It would tend to be in a loop. If I tried to unloop it, it wouldn't output anything other than the menu. However, I was able to complete the purpose; unfortunately, it came with the loop. If I were to improve it more I would've added a possible suggestion box where if someone mispelled spinach and put spenach, it would suggest the right spelling. I would add more cohesiveness to the code. 
What pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
I wanted to minimize the code in the main() function to simply the execution of the code and be able to troubleshoot what the problem was. If there was a problem with option 1, it would not let me search the item which was a void function searchItem(). There was trouble with searching for the code in the beginning, but  through trial and error I found that I was missing the int inside the parentheses (cons string& item). 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
C++ will help me utilize this in my portfolio. Clock displays and tracking will be great options to create more passion projects that I can use for software development. C++ gives an opportunity for data management, debugging, and another language for a company to use. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I did an incremental troubleshooting as I went through the code. I put in the main parts that was required a private and public class. I included mapping in reference to our Zybooks. Then I started with the main function's purpose of a menu. With the menu, I created routes for the possibilities of the four options with void functions to return the value necessary.
